>Among those who endorse mild manic symptoms during their lifetime, impulsivity predicts the onset of diagnoses of bipolar disorder (Ng, 2016; Kwapil et al., 2000).(p. [6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EUIVFNDG?page=6&annotation=4DMMQUEA))

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>Although participants were asked to describe their impulsivity during periods of wellness, it remains possible that the experience of manic episodes changes self-perceptions of impulsivity. To control for this possibility, analog studies of those who have not yet met diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder have been conducted using the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS), which covers mild(p.

>manic symptoms across the life course, as well as personality traits related to manic vulnerability, such as extraversion (Kwapil, Chapman, & Chapman, 2000). The HPS has been well-validated as predicting the onset of bipolar disorder (Kwapil et al., 2000; Walsh, Royal, Brown, Barrantes-Vidal, & Kwapil, 2012). Findings indicate that higher HPS scores are correlated with higher levels of emotion-related impulsivity, as measured using the Positive Urgency Measure, across two large samples (Giovanelli, Hoerger, Johnson, & Gruber, 2013). The HPS has also been tied to the Carver et al. (2011) emotion-related impulsivity factors, with a particularly large correlation with Feelings Trigger Action, r 5 .49, N 5 257, P , .001, but also a significant correlation with Pervasive Influence of Feelings, r 5 .22, N 5 257, P , .001 (Johnson et al., 2013). Controlling for alcohol-related symptoms and depressive symptoms, the HPS remained significantly correlated with Feelings Trigger Action (partial r 5 .43, N 5 153, P , .001; Johnson et al., 2013).  Taken together, findings suggest that bipolar disorder, even during remission, is related to significant elevations in emotion-related impulsivity. These effects can be documented before onset, and appear to generalize across both positive and negative emotion states. In bipolar disorder, the lack of constraint over emotion appears most expressed in tendencies to act and speak without thinking when experiencing emotions, and does not appear to be explained by comorbid conditions. A natural next question is how well emotion-related impulsivity can help explain poor outcomes within bipolar disorder.(p. [7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EUIVFNDG?page=7&annotation=UBKRA7QU))

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>there now is evidence that the link between emotionrelated impulsivity and response inhibition is fairly specific. First, evidence supports Negative Urgency as more strongly related to poor response inhibition than are other dimensions of impulsivity (Cyders & Coskunpinar, 2011).(p. [11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EUIVFNDG?page=11&annotation=Q84IZF3K))

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>this effect appears to be relatively specific to response inhibition, in that researchers have not found that emotion-related impulsivity was tied to delay discounting, resistance to distractor, proactive interference, shifting, inattention, or other indices of impulsive decision-making (Cyders & Coskunpinar, 2011; Sharma et al., 2014).(p.
