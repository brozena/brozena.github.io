Abstract:  Micro-interventions are quick focused behavioural interventions aimed at matching users’ current capacity for engagement. Mobile devices are powerful, interactive, and sensor-rich platforms for delivering micro-interventions and for determining when and where to do so. This paper presents a novel smart-phone based approach to microinterventions based on established ‘Episodic Future Thinking (EFT)’ research. The paper both presents the background for EFT-based microinterventions and the design of an ‘EFT’ smartphone application implementing this. The approach and technology were evaluated in a feasibility study including 14 participants using the system for 14 days. Results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing EFT as micro-interventions, with participants willing to use the application, providing positive feedback and constructive suggestions. The paper concludes with a thorough discussion of the implications for smartphone-based EFT delivered as micro-interventions and how these can be used as part of a larger behaviour change and health improvement initiatives.
