Abstract:  BACKGROUND: The classic Marshmallow Test, where children were offered a choice between one small but immediate reward (eg, one marshmallow) or a larger reward (eg, two marshmallows) if they waited for a period of time, instigated a wealth of research on the relationships among impulsive responding, self-regulation, and clinical and life outcomes. Impulsivity is a hallmark feature of self-regulation failures that lead to poor health decisions and outcomes, making understanding and treating impulsivity one of the most important constructs to tackle in building a culture of health. Despite a large literature base, impulsivity measurement remains difficult due to the multidimensional nature of the construct and limited methods of assessment in daily life. Mobile devices and the rise of mobile health (mHealth) have changed our ability to assess and intervene with individuals remotely, providing an avenue for ambulatory diagnostic testing and interventions. Longitudinal studies with mobile devices can further help to understand impulsive behaviors and variation in state impulsivity in daily life.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate an impulsivity mHealth diagnostics and monitoring app called Digital Marshmallow Test (DMT) using both the Apple and Android platforms for widespread dissemination to researchers, clinicians, and the general public.
METHODS: The DMT app was developed using Apple's ResearchKit (iOS) and Android's ResearchStack open source frameworks for developing health research study apps. The DMT app consists of three main modules: self-report, ecological momentary assessment, and active behavioral and cognitive tasks. We conducted a study with a 21-day assessment period (N=116 participants) to validate the novel measures of the DMT app.
RESULTS: We used a semantic differential scale to develop self-report trait and momentary state measures of impulsivity as part of the DMT app. We identified three state factors (inefficient, thrill seeking, and intentional) that correlated highly with established measures of impulsivity. We further leveraged momentary semantic differential questions to examine intraindividual variability, the effect of daily life, and the contextual effect of mood on state impulsivity and daily impulsive behaviors. Our results indicated validation of the self-report sematic differential and related results, and of the mobile behavioral tasks, including the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and Go-No-Go task, with relatively low validity of the mobile Delay Discounting task. We discuss the design implications of these results to mHealth research.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential for assessing different facets of trait and state impulsivity during everyday life and in clinical settings using the DMT mobile app. The DMT app can be further used to enhance our understanding of the individual facets that underlie impulsive behaviors, as well as providing a promising avenue for digital interventions.

>For impulsivity, EMA methodology can be used to understand intraindividual variability and the situational factors of impulsive beha vior [29,49]. Our DMT app includes a variety of EMA questions based on the semantic differential scale [46,50] that are prompted in the morning and the evening every day.(p.

>we adapted three relevant behavioral and cognitive performance tasks to mobile devices. Specifically, we adapted three laboratory behavioral measures related to impulse control: mobile Balloon Analogue Risk Task (mBART), mobile Go-No-Go (mGNG), and mobile Delay Discounting (mDD). These tasks were modified visually to conform to mobile phone specifications, and were adapted to be used daily to measure behavioral manifestations of impulse control and behavior. For example, the mBART presented users with 15 balloons in each trial and took about 2 minutes to complete (Figure 3). Additional details on the development of active tasks can be found in the DMT project folder at the OSF [55].(p. [5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VPAIK4K8?page=5&annotation=76XILAQU))

>We used two of the most common generalized impulsivity questionnaires: the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and the Urgency, Premeditation (lack of), Perseverance (lack of), Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS). The BIS is the most widely cited instrument for the assessment of impulsiveness, and has been used to advance understanding of this construct and its relationship to other clinical phenomena [47,61]. We used a shorter version called BIS-15 [62]. The BIS-15 scale measures three aspects of impulsivity: attention (inability to focus attention or concentrate), motor (to act without thinking), and nonplanning (lack of future orientation or forethought). The UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale [13] assesses impulsivity on the subscales of urgency (acting rashly under conditions of negative affect), lack of premeditation (difficulty in thinking and reflecting on consequences of an act), lack of perseverance (inability to remain focused on a task), and sensation seeking (tendency and openness to try and enjoy exciting or dangerous activities). These subscales have a heterogeneous relationship with psychopathology [16](p. [7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VPAIK4K8?page=7&annotation=K6GPUB9H))

>In this study, we validated self-report, EMA, and behavioral measures of impulsive behavior on mobile devices. Overall, we validated our mobile assessments against previously validated clinical measures of impulsivity such as the BIS-15 and UPPS. We also examined the psychometric properties of our novel measures. Descriptive statistics and analyses are available in the DMT project folder at the OSF [55].(p.

>We found that individuals were more impulsive, distracted, aimless, tired, pessimistic, and thrill-seeking in the evening compared to the morning. Otherwise, we found that individuals report similar levels of boredom, loneliness, ashamedness, and frustration in mornings and evenings. These results help highlight variations in the facets of impulsivity across the day. Measures that can be attributed to physical and mental depletion [76] had the most variability from morning to evening, whereas those that assess trait-based characteristics were more stable.(p.

>Despite the predictive power of laboratory and self-report measures on trait impulsivity, more research is needed with different samples to disentangle the relationship between impulsivity and health outcomes [2,28,29]. Our study revealed similar results to previous studies that impulsivity is not a unitary construct but is rathercomposed of qualitatively different constructs, which may or may not have some overlap [22].(p.

>Future studies should account for contextual factors such as setting, mood, and intentionality to further disentangle the relationship between trait and state impulsivity, and the different dimensions measured by these tools. Contextual factors can also be used to design more precise behavior change and digital health interventions with mobile technology [88,90-93].(p.
