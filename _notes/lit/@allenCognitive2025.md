Abstract:  Background: Inhibitory deficits are common in psychopathology. Emotion-related impulsivity (ERI) and rumination are general risk factors for psychiatric distress that are similarly associated with dysfunctional inhibition—particularly in affective contexts. A number of cognitive remediation procedures have been developed to improve inhibitory control; however, most remediation programs focus on “cold” cognition independent of affective processing. This pilot trial will gather preliminary evidence for a new cognitive training intervention targeting “hot” affective control (ie, inhibitory functions during elevated emotional arousal) in a transdiagnostic sample of adults who report heightened emotion dysregulation. Objective: This manuscript describes a protocol for a pilot randomized waitlist-controlled trial to assess changes in ERI and rumination after neurobehavioral affective control training (N-ACT), an 8-week cognitive training intervention designed to improve emotional response inhibition and emotional working memory. Our primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of N-ACT in reducing rumination and ERI, which we respectively conceptualize as complementary cognitive and behavioral consequences of emotion dysregulation. Secondarily, we will examine whether N-ACT leads to improvements in inhibitory control and, more distally, psychopathology symptoms. Methods: The final sample will comprise 80 adults who report high ERI or rumination. Participants will be randomized to (1) begin the N-ACT program without delay or (2) join a waitlist condition and then complete N-ACT. Exclusion criteria include active alcohol or substance use disorders, psychosis, and suicide risk. At the baseline and postintervention time points, participants will complete measures of emotion dysregulation and psychiatric symptoms, as well as a neuropsychological assessment of inhibitory control. Individuals assigned to the control group will undergo an identical assessment before joining the waitlist, followed by parallel assessments before and after N-ACT. Results: This trial is funded by support from the University of California Board of Regents and the Peder Sather Foundation (funding period: October 2022-September 2025). Recruitment is scheduled to begin in spring 2025. We will begin data analysis once data collection is complete, which is planned to occur in fall 2025. Conclusions: This pilot randomized waitlist-controlled trial is designed to assess the initial efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of N-ACT, a novel cognitive remediation approach developed to address 2 key contributors to psychopathology: ERI and rumination. The N-ACT program uses computerized adaptive behavioral tasks to strengthen the affective control processes theoretically and empirically linked to ERI and rumination. We hope this work will help inform future studies with sufficient statistical power to ascertain whether enhancing affective control through cognitive training (N-ACT) produces downstream reductions in psychiatric symptoms via improved emotion regulation.
