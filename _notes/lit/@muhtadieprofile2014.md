Abstract:  Objective Bipolar disorder has been associated with elevated impulsivity – a complex construct subsuming multiple facets. We aimed to compare specific facets of impulsivity in bipolar disorder, including those related to key psychological correlates of the illness: reward sensitivity and strong emotion. Method Ninety-one individuals diagnosed with bipolar I disorder (inter-episode period) and 80 controls completed several well-validated impulsivity measures, including those relevant to reward (Fun-seeking subscale of the Behavioral Activation System scale) and emotion (Positive Urgency and Negative Urgency scales). Results Bipolar participants reported higher impulsivity scores than did controls on all of the impulsivity measures, except the Fun-seeking subscale of the Behavioral Activation System scale. Positive Urgency – a measure assessing the tendency to act impulsively when experiencing strong positive emotion – yielded the largest group differences: F(1,170) = 78.69, P < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.316. Positive Urgency was also associated with poorer psychosocial functioning in the bipolar group: ΔR2 = 0.24, b = −0.45, P < 0.001. Conclusion Individuals with bipolar I disorder appear to be at particular risk of behaving impulsively when experiencing strong positive emotions. Findings provide an important first step toward developing a more refined understanding of impulsivity in bipolar disorder with the potential to inform targeted interventions.

>More recently, two factor analytically derived scales were developed to measure trait-like tendencies to act impulsively when experiencing strong emotion: the Positive Urgency (23) and Negative Urgency (16) scales assess tendencies to act impulsively when experiencing strong positive and strong negative emotions, respectively.(p.

>As shown in Table 2, these one-way ANOVAs yielded significant group differences for five of the six impulsivity variables (all except BAS Fun-seeking), with Positive Urgency yielding the largest effect size among the impulsivity variables.(p.

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>The largest group difference (in terms of effect size) was observed for Positive Urgency, a facet of impulsivity that assesses the tendency to behave impulsively when experiencing strong positive emotions. This finding withstood control for comorbid anxiety disorders, impulse control disorders, and lifetime history of substance use disorders. In fact, Positive Urgency accounted for one-third of the variance in diagnosis of bipolar disorder and explained considerable variance in psychosocial functioning within the bipolar group.(p.

>This profile suggests two potential targets for therapeutic intervention in bipolar I disorder: i) developing effective emotion regulation strategies to maintain healthy levels of positive emotion and ii) implementing plans for preventing impulsive behavior when strong positive emotions do unfold.(p.
