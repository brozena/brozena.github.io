Abstract:  Despite the robust body of work on cognitive aspects of bipolar disorder (BD), a clear profile of associated impairments in impulsivity, decision-making and risk-taking from studies that use behavioural measures has yet to be established. A systematic review, across four electronic databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE/PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus), of literature published between January 1999 and December 2018 was carried out in accordance with the PRISMA statement. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018114684). A fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analysis using the Hedges’ g (ES) estimate was performed. The analysis revealed significant impairment in BD individuals with medium effect sizes in various aspects of impulsivity – response inhibition (ES = 0.49; p < 0.0001), delay of gratification (ES = 0.54; p < 0.0001) and inattention (ES = 0.49; p < 0.0001) – and in decision-making (ES = 0.61, p = 0.0002), but no significant impairment in risk-taking behaviour (ES = 0.41; p = 0.0598). Furthermore, we found significant heterogeneity between studies for decision-making and risk-taking behaviour but not for impulsivity. Impaired risk-taking behaviour was significant in a subgroup of BD-I and euthymic individuals (ES = 0.92; p < 0.0001) with no significant heterogeneity. A stratification analysis revealed comparable results in euthymic and noneuthymic individuals for impulsivity. Our findings suggest that behaviour impulsivity is elevated in all phases of BD, representing a core and clinically relevant feature that persists beyond mood symptoms. More studies about decision-making and risk-taking are necessary to establish if they are impaired in BD and to analyze the role of mood state.

>Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct that can be defined as a predisposition to rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli that fail to take into account the negative consequences of those reactions to the individual him-/herself or to others (Moeller, Barratt, Dougherty, Schmitz, & Swann, 2001)(p. [](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7XA3NYL8?page=&annotation=NPGTNCMK))

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>Some authors have suggested that behavioural manifestations of this domain include three different components: (a) response inhibition: involving the ability to withhold a speeded motor response prior to its initiation or the ability to cancel a response after it has been initiated (Wright, Lipszyc, Dupuis, Thayapararajah, & Schachar, 2014); (b) delay of gratification: preference for immediately-available small rewards v. large but delayed rewards; and (c) inattention: the inability to maintain one’s attention in order to complete a task without being distracted (Strakowski et al., 2009, 2010).(p.

>although risk-taking behaviour is often part of the clinical presentation of BD, very few studies have formally assessed risk-taking propensity in these patients.(p. [2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7XA3NYL8?page=2&annotation=D6TWK7DG))

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>It is important to note that behavioural measures of impulsivity can be subdivided into those that explore response inhibition, those that explore the ability to delay gratification and those that explore inattention.(p. [7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7XA3NYL8?page=7&annotation=3QZF8YL7))
