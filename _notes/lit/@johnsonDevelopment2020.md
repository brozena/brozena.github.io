Abstract:  Trait-like tendencies to respond impulsively to emotion, labelled emotion-related impulsivity, are robustly related to aggression. We developed and tested an online intervention to address emotion-related impulsivity and aggression. The 6-session intervention focused on behavioral techniques shown to decrease arousal and aggression, supplemented with implementation intentions and smartphone prompts to facilitate skills transfer into daily life. First, we piloted the intervention in-person with 4 people. Then, 235 participants were randomly assigned to take the online intervention immediately or after a wait-list period; those in the waitlist were then invited to take part in the intervention. Participants completed the self-rated Feelings Trigger Action Scale to assess emotion-related impulsivity, the interview-based Modified Overt Aggression Scale and the self-rated Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Participants who took part in the treatment completed daily anger logs. Attrition, as with other online programs, was high; however, treatment completers reported high satisfaction, and outcomes changed more rapidly during treatment than waitlist across all key outcome indices. In analyses including all participants who took part in the treatment (immediate or delayed), we observed moderate-to-large treatment gains, which were maintained as of the 3-month follow-up assessment. This work supports the usefulness of an intervention for addressing emotion-related impulsivity and aggression.

>1.5.4. Self-monitoring  Participants were asked to complete logs three times per day for two weeks after session 2. In each log, participants were asked whether they had felt angry since the last prompt. Those who endorsed anger were asked about the intensity of anger, physiological sensations, expression and duration of anger, triggers, persons involved, their coping responses (including relaxation exercises), and the effectiveness of those responses on a scale from 1 (made worse) to 10 (felt much less angry). After two weeks of logging, participants were given written personalized feedback about their patterns of anger and aggression and the effectiveness of various coping strategies. Participants were asked to complete identical logging procedures for two weeks before the posttreatment assessment and for two weeks before three-month follow-up.(p.

>1.5.5. Implementation intentions  In the fifth session, participants were taught to create an implementation intention plan to use a coping skill (e.g., relaxation or other personally preferred strategies) if they encountered high-risk situations for anger. They were informed that committing to a skill makes one more likely to use that skill when angry. Participants were guided through forming an implementation intention, including the Wish (e.g., stop yelling at my partner), Outcome (e.g., better relationship), Obstacle (e.g., responding too quickly to being angry), and Plan (e.g., leave the room for 10 min when I am angry). They were encouraged to practice and log results daily using the WOOP app (woopmylife.org/ app; Saddawi-Konefka et al., 2017).(p.
