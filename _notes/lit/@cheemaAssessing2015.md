Abstract:  Introduction: Impulsivity and risk-taking behaviours are reported in bipolar disorder (BD). We examined whether ﬁnancial management skills are related to impulsivity in patients with BD.
Methods: We assessed ﬁnancial management skills using the Executive Personal Finance Scale (EPFS), impulsivity using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and response inhibition using an emotional go/no-go task in bipolar individuals (N = 21) and healthy controls (HC; N = 23).
Results: Patients had fewer ﬁnancial management skills and higher levels of impulsivity than HC. In patients and controls, increased impulsivity was associated with poorer personal ﬁnancial management. Patients and HC performed equally on the emotional go/no-go task. Higher BIS scores were associated with faster reaction times in HC. In patients, however, higher BIS scores were associated with slower reaction times, possibly indicating compensatory cognitive strategies to counter increased impulsivity.
Conclusions: Patients with BD may have reduced abilities to manage personal ﬁnances, when compared against healthy participants. Difﬁculty with personal ﬁnance management may arise in part as a result of increased levels of impulsivity. Patients may learn to compensate for increased impulsivity by modulating response times in our experimental situations although whether such compensatory strategies generalize to real-world situations is unknown.

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>Number of previous illness episodes did not affect performance on the emotional go/no-go task, and there were no associations with number of illness episodes and scores on the EPFS or the BIS.(p. [10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNRDGBPK?page=10&annotation=XCZ5WTZ4))>
> **comment:**
> Does number of episodes, prior hospitalizations, etc predict financial instability?

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>Even when euthymic, patients reported poorer financial management skills and in both groups, there were negative correlations between the BIS and EPFS, suggesting that individuals with higher levels of trait impulsivity had poorer scores on the EPFS.(p. [10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNRDGBPK?page=10&annotation=DPQQY7T7))>
> **comment:**
> "even while euthymic" <- financial management might be accentuated during episodes, but it does not wholly depend on them

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>They also highlight that patients partially compensated for high levels of impulsivity on a response-inhibition task by slowing down, i.e., increasing RTs (Table 2). Patients with BD may not translate such compensatory mechanisms into other domains (e.g., those pertaining to successful or appropriate financial management skills) particularly during more acute illness phases.(p. [10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNRDGBPK?page=10&annotation=HLABRRD9))>

> Role of deliberate slowing-down

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>Previous studies have proposed that patients may use a compensatory cognitive control strategy to increase accuracy and maintain sustained attention, at the expense of speed (Fleck, Shear, & Strakowski, 2005). This compensation reflects additional processing resources that are required to maintain attention in BD (Fleck et al., 2005).(p.
