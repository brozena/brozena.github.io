Abstract:  Emotion-related impulsivity, the trait-like tendency toward regrettable behavior during states of high emotion, is a robust predictor of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Despite substantial evidence that emotion-related impulsivity is important transdiagnostically, relatively little is known about its cognitive correlates. This systematic review and meta-regression investigates one such candidate, risky decision-making. We analyzed 195 effect sizes from 51 studies of 14,957 total participants, including 105 newly calculated effect sizes that were not reported in the original publications. The meta-regression demonstrated evidence for a small, positive relationship of emotion-related impulsivity with behavioral indices of risky decision-making (ß = 0.086). Effects generalized across sample age, gender, Positive versus Negative Urgency, and clinical versus nonclinical samples. The average effect size varied by task type, with stronger effects for the Iowa Gambling Task and Delay Discounting Task. Experimental arousal manipulation was nearly a significant moderator, with stress and pharmacological manipulations yielding significant effect sizes. Analyses indicated that publication bias did not skew the current findings. Notwithstanding limitations, the data suggest that risky decision-making is a cognitive domain that relates to emotion-related impulsivity. We conclude with recommendations regarding the specific types of tasks and arousal inductions that will best capture emotion-related impulsivity in future experimental research.

>Accordingly, we prefer the term emotion-related impulsivity to denote this trait-like tendency to respond impulsively to positive and negative emotions.(p. [2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T664LZQY?page=2&annotation=7QJFFIV6))>
> **comment:**
> Positive Urgency and Negative Urgency correlate highly enough that "emotion-related impulsivity" serves as a "valence-free" version of the construct.

>The consistency of these neuroimaging findings supports the idea that risky decision-making is related to emotion-related impulsivity; however, syntheses of the studies using behavioral measures have been less clear.(p. [2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T664LZQY?page=2&annotation=AWFWW95M))

> [!annotation-yellow] Highlight
>Research has shown that a common measure of risky decision-making, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, did not correlate with other measures of decision-making and risktaking, such as the Iowa Gambling Task or delay of gratification indices (Sharma et al., 2014). Conceptual divisions also exist. For example, gambling tasks measure decision-making when consequences are uncertain, whereas the consequences of choices in delay discounting tasks are certain. Therefore, the types of risk or cost associated with decisions in these tasks may be important to tease apart.(p. [3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/T664LZQY?page=3&annotation=RV3HMEJ3))
