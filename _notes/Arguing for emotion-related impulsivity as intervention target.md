title: Arguing for emotion-related impulsivity as intervention target

- [[@ramirez-martinImpulsivity2020#^6c6cf1|Define impulsivity]]
	- [[@ramirez-martinImpulsivity2020#^72e8cc|Behavioral measures of impulsivity]] are subdivided into (1) response inhibition, (2) ability to delay gratification, and (3) inattention
	- [[@cheemaAssessing2015#^a83533|Measures of financial management competency]] have been shown to be (1) lower than control for those with BD even during euthymic states, and, (2) negatively correlated to trait impulsivity
	- [[@elliottEmotionrelated2023#^979b47|Define risky decision-making: modulation of goal pursuit based on situational risks or costs]]
- Link trait impulsivity to bipolar disorder via positive urgency
	- [[@ngImpulsivity2016|Impulsivity predicts diagnosis of BD for those with lifetime mild manic symptoms]]
	- [[@muhtadieprofile2014#^6892d9|Trait-like tendencies to act impulsively when experiencing strong positive/negative emotions have been measured using Positive Urgency and Negative Urgency scales]]
	- [[@muhtadieprofile2014#^2355c4|Largest group difference between BD/control groups were shown in Positive Urgency effect size after controlling for anxiety disorders, impulse control disorders, lifetime history of substance use disorders]]
		- Study design: 91 IwBD inter-episode period with 80 controls
- Link positive/negative urgency to ERI
	- [[@elliottEmotionrelated2023#^23ec3b|Define ERI]] as valence-free version of the Positive/Negative Urgency construct
		- because [[@johnsonImpulsive2020|these two scales are highly correlated]]
	- [[@johnsonEmotionRelated2018#^1f42e8|ERI in BD persists during euthymic states]]
- Situate ERI as a potential **therapeutic target for risky decision-making (via delay discounting)**
	- [[@elliottEmotionrelated2023#^e383de|Neuroimaging findings consistently support the idea that risky decision-making is related to ERI]]
		- ("Three functional MRI studies have replicated a correlation of emotion-related impulsivity with increased anterior insula activation during decision-making tasks involving risk...")
	- [[@elliottEmotionrelated2023#^d9a303|Meta-analyses have found]] a "==highly significant correlation of ERI with risky decision-making, which was small but replicated across many types of laboratory tasks==“
		- [[@elliottEmotionrelated2023#^926f21|Iowa Gambling & Delay Discounting Tasks were correlated with ERI]]
- Identify how ERI has been incorporated into **existing digital interventions for BD**
	- [[@johnsonDevelopment2020|aggression]]
	- [[@allenCognitive2025|rumination]]
- Identify other **models for digital intervention** (i.e., ways to measure or reduce delay discounting)π
	- [[@perssonEpisodic2023|episodic future thinking]]
		- idea: EFT (rich/emotive/descriptive), prime/remind of this 3, 2, 1 days prior to recurring deposit and/or during delay discounting tasks, then monitor metrics of financial behavior following deposit
- Identify potential **outcome measures**
	- Delay Discounting
