title: Mapping a dissertation
---

Partly to keep myself sane and partly to work out in the open, I'll be writing my dissertation in chunks and putting those chunks here.

As a demo for now, see how I'm [[Arguing for emotion-related impulsivity as intervention target]].

Note to self: Maybe I'll use this as a map of chapters with each chapter linking to individual notes.
