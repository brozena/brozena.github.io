title: Mapping a dissertation
---

I'm writing my dissertation as [atomic notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic) using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and putting those online via [jekyll-wikirefs](https://github.com/wikibonsai/jekyll-wikirefs).

As a demo of this mechanism for now, see how I'm [[Arguing for emotion-related impulsivity as intervention target]].

Note to self: Maybe I'll use this as a map of chapters with each chapter linking to individual notes.
