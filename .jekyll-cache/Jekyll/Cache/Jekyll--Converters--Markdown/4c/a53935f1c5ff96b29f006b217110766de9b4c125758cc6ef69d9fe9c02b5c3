I"ƒ<p>Iâ€™m a PhD candidate at <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/prospective/graduate/phd-informatics">Penn State University</a> in the <a href="https://whilab.org">Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab</a> advised by <a href="https://saeedabdullah.com">Dr Saeed Abdullah</a>. <strong>Iâ€™m interested in technical human-computer interaction for serious mental illness</strong>.</p>

<p>I am working on how financial technology might <strong>help with the unique financial challenges faced by those living with bipolar disorder</strong>. My work is currently supported by the National Science Foundation via the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program">Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a>.</p>

<p>Previously <strong>I led the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation">digital transformation</a></strong> of what was one of the countryâ€™s largest and highest-quality closely-held Medicaid groups, <a href="https://www.smiles4keeps.com">Smiles 4 Keeps Pediatric Dentistry</a>.

<p><span data-nosnippet="">I am a long-time advocate for mental health issues and am open about my lived experience with bipolar disorder. I founded Penn Stateâ€™s <a href="https://www.activeminds.org">Active Minds</a> chapter back in 2010.
