<p>I first heard the sound of tabla in high school. Mickey Hart and Zakir Hussain
playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkubRK-RRUQ">Sweet Sixteen</a>. Then it
was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrU3EppRwNA">American Beauty score</a>.
Fascinated by the sound, I kept this interest on the back burner for years.
I would pretend to speak the syllables instead of singing in the shower. At
some point, I told a friend I would put down drumsticks and only play with my
hands.</p>

<p>Throughout my twenties, the dream of playing became much bigger. I started to
approach classical music by listening to Zakir Hussain’s “Selects” and Ravi
Shankar’s “The Master Drummers of India” – but without being familiar with any
of the concepts of Indian rhythm I was both lost and in love.</p>

<p>Thanks to a chance encounter at Penn State University Park in spring of 2008,
I was gifted a set of tabla by an astrophysics postdoc named Birjoo Vaishnav.
Over a few days, I made futile attempts at getting any sound from them. A week
after the gift of these tabla, I met Quamar Barkat as we entered
a logic/discrete math course. He was practicing tabla on the desk and
I recognized it for what it was. Quamar and I worked together for some time on
fundamentals between State College and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Back at Penn State in 2010, I became involved with a student group called PSU
Geet. We hosted musicians like Samarth Nagarkar, Nitin Mitta and Anupama
Bhagwat for Hindustani classical concerts at PSU. And so I became exposed to
New York City’s indian classical scene.</p>

<p>I returned home to Scranton to meet my next teacher Bhimsen Mudaljikar. Bhimsen
has been in the United States since the 1970s, keeping up his practice and
teaching students in the region.</p>

<p>Here the Indian community would gather regionally in small and large groups for
bhajans, coming together for chanting and food. All I can say is Northeastern
Pennsylvania is home to so much.</p>

<p>Having been introduced by Samarth Nagarkar, I began traveling to study with
<a href="http://danweiss.net">Dan Weiss</a> beginning in 2011. I would drive from Scranton
to Brooklyn as often as I could manage, averaging weekly or monthly through the
years – sometimes several times a week to listen to gigs.</p>

<p>As I finished an apprenticeship/professional commitment in Scranton,
Pennsylvania (rare to find, especially there), I chose to move to New York to
pursue the music deeper. I was a late and grateful tenant of the small room on
Woodruff Ave 4a where many other like-minded musicians had started out in New
York.</p>

<h3 id="desire-and-discipline">Desire and Discipline</h3>

<p>Having returned to Penn State for now, I now understand how intrinsic my love
of music and especially this instrument is to me. I desire to practice in this
tradition as sincerely as I can and afford myself the time to really do it.</p>

<p>I can finally see this practice as both a means and an end.</p>

<p>I can imagine beautiful moments will follow as they have over the last ten
years. But today I can feel how light my dream is, finally free of
expectation’s weight. Each moment I sit down to play and listen is a beautiful
moment.</p>

<p>This took a long time. Which is to say, <strong>forgiveness opens up the possibility
of creation</strong>.</p>
