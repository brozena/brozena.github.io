I"Ò<p>I decided to move to New York City in November 2017 after spending the better part of 6 years commuting from Scranton, Pennsylvania to study <a href="/tabla">tabla</a> with <a href="http://www.danweiss.net">Dan Weiss</a>. I would sometimes drive from Scranton to Brooklyn several times a week to get to gigs. On the way home I would sleep in my car somewhere until I had enough energy to get home. I would go to work the following day. I saw no other option.</p>
