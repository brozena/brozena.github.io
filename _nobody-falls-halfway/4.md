**While I was away, I was -- somewhat ironically -- asked to chime in on Twitter with some advice for managing this illness well. Do take note of the timestamps.**

**Months later in State College, on one of the more difficult days, just beginning medication treatment and meditating hours per day, I realized that I had finally managed to take my own advice.**

### In conclusion

If you have read this far, thanks so much for taking an interest and for your patience with the piece. This period of my life was among the most dense I have ever experienced, and I could not have written this more concisely without losing meaning. Trust that it means a lot that you stayed until the end. The act of writing this piece has also been an act of putting my life back together, of making both sense and meaning of it all, and I hope it offered something to you, dear reader.

If you have any thoughts or questions, feel free to get in touch with me. I'm happy to discuss anything I shared throughout the piece.

My email is jeff at brozena dot net, or if we already know each other, you know what to do.

I thought about making a list of the many people who have been with me, who were integral to this story, but it just doesn't feel right yet. You do all know who and what you are in this life. 

⚡❤️

Thank you for everything, my friends.
