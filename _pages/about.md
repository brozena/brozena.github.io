I'm a PhD candidate at [Penn State University](https://ist.psu.edu/prospective/graduate/phd-informatics) in the [Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab](https://whilab.org) advised by [Dr Saeed Abdullah](https://saeedabdullah.com). **I'm interested in technical human-computer interaction for serious mental illness**.

I am working on how financial technology might **help with the unique financial challenges faced by those living with bipolar disorder**. My work is currently supported by the National Science Foundation via the [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program).

Previously **I led the [digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation)** of what was one of the country's largest and highest-quality closely-held Medicaid groups, [Smiles 4 Keeps Pediatric Dentistry](https://www.smiles4keeps.com). With minimal supervision and years of close mentorship by its owner, I stewarded this unique group from paper operations to a centralized (and salable) state by integrating [OpenDental](https://www.opendental.com) in the midst of a cross-generational transfer of family leadership.

<span data-nosnippet>I am a long-time advocate for mental health issues and am open about my lived experience with bipolar disorder. I founded Penn State's [Active Minds](https://www.activeminds.org) chapter back in 2010. If this sort of thing interests you, **you may want to check out my essay [Nobody Falls Halfway](/nobody-falls-halfway/)**.</span>

I'm writing my dissertation with the garage door up --- **see [[diss|my notes]]** if you're interested in following along.

My CV is available [here](assets/BrozenaCV.pdf).
