The PhD news: Year four is underway. I'm currently recruiting for an interview/data collection study involving [money behaviors and bipolar disorder](https://whilab.org/projects/bd-finhealth.html). We're aiming to design personalized, privacy-preserving, supportive financial technologies tailored to this illness. 

I'll be traveling to Japan for [CHI 2025](https://chi2025.acm.org/) where I'm co-organizing a workshop [The Future of Money and HCI](https://chi2025.acm.org/for-authors/workshops/accepted-workshops/#w3).

I'm really enjoying reading [Ways of Seeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing) by [John Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berger). I'm also excited for [All Media is Training Data](https://shop.serpentinegalleries.org/products/holly-herndon-mat-dryhurst-all-media-is-training-data) by [Holly Herndon & Mat Dryhurst](https://herndondryhurst.studio/).
